## Interview Questions for Autovance

**This interview process is not pass / fail**. We want you to perform as well as you can in a situation where you are comfortable.  

These questions are simple problems that we deal with every day. More important than actually solving the problems, **we want to see how you go about solving and learning about the technologies that are essential in your job**. This project is a setup representative of all our projects in some way, including testing and development frameworks.

### Interview Directions

1.  Fork the repo and work on your fork
1.  Clone and run `npm install`.
1.  Find your assigned set in the `lib` directory
1.  Complete the functions within the set
1.  Write your correctness tests for each question
1.  Check your answers by running `npm run test:set-*`
1.  Commit your answers to Github *(or zip them)*, and submit the test by linking the repo *(or sending the zip)* in an email to your interviewer!

### Required Tools

*   git
*   github account
*   nodejs + npm (latest)


### Committing

We follow the angular commit message guidelines outlined [here](https://gist.github.com/stephenparish/9941e89d80e2bc58a153).
Remember to use this format when you are committing work, or the hooks will reject your commit!

You can look at some of the existing commits in the repo for examples.

### Public vs. Private

If you want to keep your submission private, you can clone the repo locally and submit a compressed file via email to your interviewer.

We ask that you do not actively look for completed interview sets in other public forks, and try to finish the challenge on your own, as integrity and honesty are important to us.
